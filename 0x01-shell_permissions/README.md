## Tasks
### 0. My name is Betty
Create a script that switches the current user to the user `betty`.

- You should use exactly 8 characters for your command (+1 character for the new line)
- You can assume that the user `betty` will exist when we will run your script
```bash
julien@ubuntu:/tmp/h$ tail -1 0-iam_betty | wc -c
9
julien@ubuntu:/tmp/h$
```
### 1. Who am I
Write a script that prints the effective username of the current user.
```bash
julien@ubuntu:/tmp/h$ 
julien
julien@ubuntu:/tmp/h$ 
```
### 2. Groups
Write a script that prints all the groups the current user is part of.
```bash
julien@ubuntu:/tmp/h$ ./2-groups
julien adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare
julien@ubuntu:/tmp/h$ 
Note: depending on the user, you will get a different output.
```
