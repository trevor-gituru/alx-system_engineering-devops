### Background Context

In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

1. Is your `web-01` server configured according to requirements
2. Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)

For example, if I need to create a file `/tmp/test` containing the string `hello world` and modify the configuration of Nginx to listen on port `8080` instead of `80`, I can use emacs on my server to create the file and to modify the Nginx configuration file `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`.

But my answer file would contain:
```bash
sylvain@ubuntu cat 88-script_example
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Configuring a server with specification XYZ
echo hello world > /tmp/test
sed -i 's/80/8080/g' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sylvain@ubuntu
```
As you can tell, I am not using `emacs` to perform the task in my answer file. This exercise is aiming at training you on automating your work. If you can automate tasks that you do manually, you can then automate yourself out of repetitive tasks and focus your energy on something more interesting. For an [SRE](https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/devops/sre#the-devops-incident-management-process), that comes very handy when there are hundreds or thousands of servers to manage, the work cannot be only done manually. Note that the checker will execute your script as the `root` user, you do not need to use the `sudo` command.

A good Software Engineer is a [lazy Software Engineer](https://www.techwell.com/techwell-insights/2013/12/why-best-programmers-are-lazy-and-act-dumb).

**Tips:** to test your answer Bash script, feel free to reproduce the checker environment:

- start a Ubuntu 16.04 sandbox
- run your script on it
- see how it behaves

## Tasks
### 0. Transfer a file to your server
Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server:

**Requirements:**

- Accepts 4 parameters
    1. The path to the file to be transferred
    2. The IP of the server we want to transfer the file to
    3. The username `scp` connects with
    4. The path to the SSH private key that `scp` uses
- Display `Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY if less than 3 parameters passed`
- `scp` must transfer the file to the user home directory `~/`
- Strict host key checking must be disabled when using `scp`

**Example:**
```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-transfer_file
Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh ubuntu@8.8.8.8 -i /vagrant/sylvain 'ls ~/'
afile
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
sylvain@ubuntu$ touch some_page.html
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-transfer_file some_page.html 8.8.8.8 sylvain /vagrant/private_key
some_page.html                                     100%   12     0.1KB/s   00:00
sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh ubuntu@8.8.8.8 -i /vagrant/private_key 'ls ~/'
afile
some_page.html
sylvain@ubuntu$
```
In this example, I:

- remotely execute the `ls ~/` command via `ssh` to see what `~/` contains
- create a file named `some_page.html`
- execute my `0-transfer_file` script
- remotely execute the `ls ~/` command via `ssh` to see that the file `some_page.html` has been successfully transferred
That is one way of publishing your website pages to your server.
