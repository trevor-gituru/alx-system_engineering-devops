## Tasks
### 0. Install MySQL
First things first, letâ€™s get MySQL installed on both your `web-01` and `web-02` servers.

- MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x
- Make sure that [task #3](/0x0B-ssh/3-add_ssh_key) of your [SSH project](/0x0B-ssh/) is completed for `web-01` and `web-02`. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
- Please make sure you have your `README.md` pushed to GitHub.

**Example:**
```bash
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.25, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$
```
